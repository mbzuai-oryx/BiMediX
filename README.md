## 	:woman_health_worker: Overview
We introduce BiMediX, the first bilingual medical mixture of experts LLM designed for seamless interaction in both English and Arabic.  
Our model facilitates a wide range of **medical interactions** in English and Arabic, including multi-turn chats to inquire about additional details such as patient symptoms and medical history, multiple-choice question answering, and open-ended question answering.

Our models are available for download at the Project's [HuggingFace Page](https://huggingface.co/BiMediX).

## üèÜ Contributions

Our contributions are as follows: 

- We introduce BiMediX, the first bilingual medical LLM with expertise in both English and Arabic, enabling seamless medical interactions such as multi-turn chats, multiple choice, and closed question answering.
- We developed a semi-automated translation pipeline with human verification for high-quality translation of English medical texts into Arabic, aiding in the creation of a dataset and benchmark for Arabic healthcare LLM evaluation.
- We curated the BiMed1.3M dataset, a comprehensive Arabic-English bilingual instruction set with over 1.3 million instructions and 632 million healthcare-specialized tokens, supporting diverse medical interactions and enabling a chatbot for patient follow-ups, with a focus on a 1:2 Arabic-to-English ratio across medical content.
- **BiMediX outperforms existing models in medical benchmarks while being 8-times faster than comparable existing approaches.**

## ‚ö° Model 

The BiMediX model, built on the  state-of-the-art Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, leverages the [Mixtral-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1) base model. It features a router network to allocate tasks to the most relevant experts, each being specialized feedforward blocks within the model. This approach enables the model to scale significantly by utilizing a sparse operation method, where less than 13 billion parameters are active during inference, enhancing efficiency. 
The training utilized the BiMed1.3M dataset, focusing on bilingual medical interactions in both English and Arabic, with a substantial corpus of over 632 million healthcare-specialized tokens. 
The fine-tuning process included QLoRA, a low-rank adaptation technique to adapt the model efficiently to specific tasks while keeping computational demands manageable.

## üîç Data

The BiMed1.3M dataset, central to BiMediX's training, was meticulously compiled to include a wide range of medical interactions. The creation process involved generating multi-turn chat conversations using ChatGPT, based on publicly available medical MCQAs to simulate realistic doctor-patient dialogues. This dataset includes over 200,000 high-quality **multi-turn medical dialogues**, enriching the model's training material. 

A semi-automated, iterative translation process was employed to create high-quality Arabic versions of the data, utilizing ChatGPT for initial translations and human professionals for refinement. This ensured the dataset's fidelity and relevance across both English and Arabic.
Furthermore, we translated the English evaluation set to Arabic to evaluate the models. 
Through these meticulous data creation and processing efforts, BiMediX is able to excel in understanding and generating medical content across two languages.

## üìä Quantitative Results

The BiMediX model was evaluated across several benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in medical language understanding and question answering in both English and Arabic.

**Medical Benchmarks Used for Evaluation:**
   - *PubMedQA*: A dataset for question answering from biomedical research papers, requiring reasoning over biomedical contexts.
   - *MedMCQA*: Multiple-choice questions from Indian medical entrance exams, covering a wide range of medical subjects.
   - *MedQA*: Questions from US and other medical board exams, testing specific knowledge and patient case understanding.
   - *Medical MMLU*: A compilation of questions from various medical subjects, requiring broad medical knowledge.
